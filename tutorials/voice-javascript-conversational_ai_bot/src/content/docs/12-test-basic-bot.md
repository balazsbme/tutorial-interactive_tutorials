# Test Basic Bot

> **Privacy**: Your speech is sent to the configured OpenAI-compatible API for processing. Do not include personal or sensitive information during test calls.

With your server running and your Vonage application configured, call your Vonage virtual number from your phone.

You should hear:

```text
Hi, I am your AI assistant. How can I help you today?
```

Ask a short question, such as:

```text
Why is the sky blue?
```

The bot captures your speech, sends the transcription to the configured API, and reads the response back to you.

If the call does not connect or you hear an error, check that:

- the server is still running in the terminal;
- port `3000` is still public;
- the Answer URL and Event URL match your current Codespace URL;
- your Vonage number is linked to the Voice Application;
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `project/.env` and matches the provider selected by `OPENAI_BASE_URL`.
